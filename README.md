tutorial for learning the ins and outs of GitHub
Hello, I am more experienced than I first was. I tip my hat off to those who have become self-taught developers. One thing I have learned over the course of time , is that learning the material in and of itself is not the main obstacle. The hardest part is having the discipline to keep on moving forward , retaining and refining what you have learned in the past. I havent been as consistent as I know I should have , but I also havent given up yet. The goal is to keep on moving , I know that is all that is required to reach goals.
